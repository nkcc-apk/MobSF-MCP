# MobSF-MCP 

Architecture based on [https://github.com/GH05TCREW/mobsf-mcp](https://github.com/GH05TCREW/mobsf-mcp)

## üìë Overview

MobSF MCP is a Node.js-based Model Context Protocol implementation for Mobile Security Framework (MobSF). It provides a standardized interface for integrating MobSF's security analysis capabilities into automated workflows and third-party tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Running instance of [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) with API access 
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  And Usage

Clone the repository or navigate to the mobsf-mcp directory, and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g mobsf-mcp
```

Configure environment variables and start the MobSF MCP server by using the npx command:

> üìö Open PowerShell as an administrator
```bash
$env:MOBSF_URL="http://localhost:8000"; 
$env:MOBSF_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"; 
npx mobsf-mcp
```
